# Weather-App-Using-API
A practical project to improve my skills after learning about API's.

This is a simple <b>Weather App</b> created using <b>OpenWeather's API</b>.

It first prompts the user to enter the city name; after entering the city name in the text field, press the search icon to see the current weather for that location.
